# [HanA Demo](http://hansagastyra.esy.es)

This is my version of HTML5 Boilerplate.
Basically I just make it fit my needs of a simple web project using Foundation and SASS.

## How To Use It
Feel free to use it, it's just another version of HTML5 Boilerplate.
Since I deleted some stuff, maybe you will need to add icons or something like that.
